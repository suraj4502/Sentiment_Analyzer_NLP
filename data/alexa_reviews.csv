Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Google is infinitely better,1.0,"Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn't be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let's begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren't highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that's Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don't care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90's. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. ""Who is the tallest man?"" It'll give you the answer, but if you follow up with ""how tall is he?"". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi's before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn't show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you're gonna get ""updating your device for 10 minutes"".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What's worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it's Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there's no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That's great, Alexa don't care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that's an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa's speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like ""turn off the light"", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor's pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I'll stop here and sulk myself with buyer's remorse."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not that useful,3.0,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. ""Alexa please play the flying jat song"". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Echo Dot never plays original songs, (No way to attach Audio Files)",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



/*Here I'm Uploading video, enjoy*/Most idiotic device I every bought, never play original songs. Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songs.I wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakers./*Some attachments after talking to Amazon Echo Dot Executive*/After my above review, Echo Dot representative called me, I'm glad for this.I showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesn't have songs that I'm selecting and it is better to add gaana.com from alexa app, after following his guidelines, I repeated and recorded issues. Please see the screen shots and listed to audio  for Alexa and have fun (Now I realise amazon review doen't support audio but only video).You can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life. The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny, if I wan't to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video :). This is called mismatch in basic requirement.I'll try to get capture view than attach here for same issues added as image. Till than enjoy."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),I recommend one more accessory,5.0,Its just one if the best deal i ever got on amazon I purchased it with a 12 watt wipro light at 2200 and enjoying it since last 2 daya its my 4th echo device and yes I would highly recommend buying a product with this just search echo dot wall mount you ll see a 800-900 rupees wall mount trust me it will make a huge difference between sound and transportability plus when its on wall if will recognise your voice quicker as it faces you on the wall seriously guys the combination of these two is compulsory
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Amazon is selling an experimental product.,1.0,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),No warranty should be given to you so be alert buy on your own risk i try different companies spkr,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Worst experience with alexa no warranty you get with this product.Amazon policy are worst. Ctdi partner an official amazon devices service partner.I have requested to Amazon to replace my alexa device with in the warranty period the refuses my request. issue is escalated bu amazon team but no follow up call can be held till today. They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. “ excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.” I think amazon policy are worst. They stand in the last of the top companies list. They have no customer satisfaction. Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown. Amazon shame Amazon shameful for you"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Loved sound quality, it's awesome",5.0,"I am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot3. One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Combo with smart bulb reaches US deal price!!!!,5.0,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA.  So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb.  Just go for it before its too late
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Value for money smart speaker,5.0,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360° view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ₹1999.What more one can ask for."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Awesome,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bought this and wipro 9w smart bulb in combo offer. Configured smart bulb in alexa. Cool thats it.Just say ""alexa, lights on"", ""alexa, turn light to red / blue"" etc.. you can alse even change the brightness ""alexa, change the brightness to 50%"" etc. You will get the manual within the wipro bulb box. There you can see the list of commands.Lets see the other options of echo dot. I connected this to home theater. It is just playing songs from any music station, my playlist. Tried these 2 options only. Mostly i play rhymes. Around INR 2500, i got this combo. Worth to play around."

 Do not buy this product. When i asked alexa that kashmir is part of which country it said china.Boycott alexa"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa Sucks,3.0,"me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I do not know that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I could not find that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I don't recognize it""search capabilities of Alexa sucks!! Even when I read out the playlist names as they are on Amazon Music, Alexa can't find those playlists. Alexa know a standard playlists like 90s bollywood, bollywood hits etc., If you are looking for Kannada playlists or for that matter any local language lists, Alexa just does not know...me ""Alexa, I have feedback"" ""You really suck!!"""
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Prompt response and issue solving by Amazon Kudos 🙂👍,5.0,"""Worst experience brought it on 12th August already stopped working since 25th September @Amazon what should be done suggest""This was my previous review but now i am amazed with customer service i got from Amazon. The adaptor for Alexa was faulty..so after the review Amazon came to know about my problem and without any delay they help me with a new adaptor without any cost.In this way within a day my issue is resolved. Thankyou Mr.Aman for your promp response and solution will never forget it.so all these stars are not for Alexa now but for Amazon 🙂u won my ❤️"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Average performance,3.0,"I am returning after trying various commands for about a week. This is a recent review.Received only 2 days ago. So initial impressions.Not checked integration. Oakremote that I purchased with Echo was a flop.+ves -Voice recognition , Quick response, Family is having fun giving commands-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwali😜"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Fantastic sound quality but alexa is useless,2.0,"In comparison with Google voice assistant devices -1. Eco dot 3 is awesome in hardware - mic recognises voice from far away distance and bass on speaker is super.2. But software experience is pathetic due to alexa which is not even 10% of google assistant. Very limited recognition of command and that too hit or miss by alexa.3. Alexa catches one command unlike combined commands in Google assistant.4. Unproductive things like telling jokes are only features of alexa. It can't even calculate dates.On/off smart plug & reminders are the only perfectly working things with Alexa !!!In layman terms - Google is hero and Alexa is joker.Limitations in speaker -Note that only 3.5mm output is possible, so eco dot 3 can't be used as 3.5mm speaker but can be used as Bluetooth speaker.You can't use mic in Bluetooth mode. So, not usable for calls.Alexa app -is inconsistent and not user-friendly. Critical features like alexa guard are not available in India.Voice recognition -It's always hit or miss with simple commands also.I bought to play online kannada music but voice recognition is limited to Bollywood movie names or artists for Indian music.It won't recognise 99% kannada music/movie/artist names.My VERDICT -Even though I got in DEC 2021 for 2299, I'm finding it useless. My usage is restricted to on/off smart plug at water heater and reminders, as reminders with 5 out 5 times whereas it's 4/5 with Google.Alexa ignored Kannada and all other South Indian languages, so time for us to ignore alexa and go with Google devices if South Indian languages are your need.Don't waste your money on alexa voice assistant devices."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good Hardware with just okayish software,3.0,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Limited capablity with very poorly designed sensors,1.0,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.3 - Dont understand english language properly.4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),A good product for everyday use,3.0,"Well amazon did a great job they explain every pros on their details*Only thing is alexa is in beta stage may be it will take some more years for this AI to work like google assistant, because most of the time alexa says "" मूझे नही पता""*Interaction in hindi is better than google assistant*Sould quality is better than my expectations*Got it on amazon GIF with wipro bulb @2300rs with 100 of cashback ✌🏻* in winter season i don't need to go out from my quilt to switch of my home devices 😂😂 Thanks amazon* Good for my parents as they can ask most of the things to alexa because they r in a phase of learning smartphones features* Only buy if u heave a wifi router, will not work good with mobile hot-spot* Smart devices most of them only supports 2.4Ghz wifi router* Smart devices cost a lot as compare to normal electronics, with this speaker u need to spend extra bucks to make your home more smarterPS- Add motion sensing LED to ur home with smart LED ... It looks cool and u dont need to shout a lot to turn it off or on and the bottom line is they r more cheaper ✌🏻"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Hits far above its weight,5.0,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Bang on Product for the price!!,5.0,"It’s an amazing product to have, especially the integration with your google calendar and tons of skills to play around with. Though hoping there will be more better software updates, butIt’s a bang on product for the price. Bought wipro bulb and echo dot together for 2449Rs and then returned the wipro bulb and got back 700Rs. So got the Alexa for just 1750Rs, which is truely a bang on for a smart assistant and a Bluetooth speaker ;)"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa is great but device needs to be improved,3.0,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.- No USB charging facility- Alexa app is horribly slow- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure itPlus features- Device shape is great- Sound quality is superb- Voice response is awesome"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),It is fantastic invention.,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Got it with Wipro smart LED bulb bundle. In 1999 both.Pros:Solid build quality.Easy setup.Capture voice even far from 10 feet.Loud and clear sound.Bass is awesome.Easy connection to your smart LED bulb.Capture all voice just anybody called ""Alexa"". It will respond.Cons:No battery inside, you need to put in its power adapter all the time.Works only if active internet connection available.You should have wifi at home to connect all devices together."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Could have been better,4.0,"We purchased Gen3.  The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings.  App has a very poor design and functionality.  Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker.  Overall, good to hear music.  AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions.  Good for wakeup alarms and listening music.  Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown.  Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify.  Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube.  Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb.  These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Keeps shouting the device name it is playing from,2.0,"Everytime I connect to the device it says playing from and mentions my device name. This comes at high volume as this volume can only be controlled through the device. But this doesn't end here. Alexa shouts playing from and my device name everytime. If I lock my system and re-login then it shouts this message. If I stay idle and don't move my mouse for 5 mins and then move it then I get this mesaage again. Sometimes it happens when I am playing videos as well. A video will be playing and suddenly Alexa shouts playing from and my device name. Unfortunately even though I tried many things to get rid of that, I wasn't able to get rid of this sound till now. When I connect to Alexa speaker for the first time it doesn't connect properly and it plays with breaking sounds. This happens many times and I have to keep disconnecting and connecting it back till it works properly. Overall it is a fine speaker but there are too many problems that I face everyday with it."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Worst Integration ever.,1.0,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in  that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Total value for money...,5.0,"In a word... Just fabulous...Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.For music it's outstanding.Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much.."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Works wonderfully, Stupidly priced",3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Works beautifully, have bought 3 to link the entire house. Frequently group and play them together, use drop in to create an intercom, and have linked to speakers, bulbs, TV and other gadgets. I would still give this only 3 stars because it is double the rate here in India compared to the US. A country with 25 TIMES India's per capita income. What is this pricing Amazon? I understand there may be taxes in India but still. 2X the price ?This not withstanding will buy a larger Echo speaker whenever there is a sale on Echo with reasonable prices."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),poor design thinking and lack of  access restrictions ruins good recognition,2.0,"I bought this as a productivity tool- during the pandemic while I drift between office work and housework, I need something to remind me of upcoming tasks or meetings.  It fails terribly due to lack of  thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require  a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further.  It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders  or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer.  Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should  have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Disappointing support for troubleshooting of Echo dot issue,1.0,"The product has intermittent issue while connecting with Phone for playing videos sound.  Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update.  Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling  in India. Though the feature is available in other countries through Echo Connect feature.Hope they will sent the replacement."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Ambient computing Marvel - Alexa,5.0,"My perception about ambient computing changed after I bought this alexa device and Iam loving this device.Alexa's voice is a bigger USP , such a soothing voiceBest WFH home companionLook up alexa skills and you will be facinated how many thousand skills it has,Check out Alexa skills in amazon website & in alexa mobileAlexa is a platform and Amazon making it better everydayThese are early days of ambient computing and no assistants are perfectYou can use google assistant from ur phone via bluetooth to get essential from google assistantSpeaker Sound quality is decent and won't  hurt your ears.Amazon adding more songs to  Amazon music and if you have prime subscription you are gonna enjoySpotify integration with Alexa is intuitive with free spotify accountWe can set out Alexa routines and blueprint feature is awesomeIOT connectivity  is seemlessAlexa reads news from Ndtv , TOI, ET, and more.Alexa market share is more than google nest,so developers line up for alexa than googleThank you amazon for creating this best Alexa speakerMuch loveAlexa user"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Gyd audio but really bad and dumb Alexa assistant..Horrible answers..Very Dissatisfied.,1.0,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing.."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Overall a OK Smart Speaker,3.0,"This review is after using echo dot gen 3 more than 2 months. While there are both Pros and Cons, this is a good device to enter into connected devices world.Pros:1. Good looking gels nicely with the environment.2. LED ring gets your attention when in need.3. Good sound quality on playback.Cons so far:1. Sound is muffled for the responses from Alexa, you can't make out clearly on what it says most of the time. No fix yet { reduced one star because of this. }. Due to this issues it's being used as just a music player most of the time.2. Compared to Google Mini, Alexa's search contextual hits are lower.3. Was unable to get Follow-up working properly."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),The integration with other app is difficult,3.0,"The integration with other app is difficult and many times it unable to perform well with voice recoginitionFlaws:1.Its difficult to pair it with smart switch and bulbs.i was not successful,in doing so2.voice recognition sucks3.the help provided ia not good at all.not a good assistqnt.4.cannot plqy music or video from yputube5.no proper help for automating6.cannot use it as output speaker with my projector7. Simple automation scripts for pairing should be provided as a sample so that ppl can directly reuse them8.it only search songs from limited platforms.that huge disappojntmentNot satisfied at all.Only thing that I like is sound of speaker"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Pathetic,1.0,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.Update:After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling itout, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),A Wonderful Assistant at Your Beck and Call,5.0,"Got a sweet prime day combo deal on this and this is my second purchase of this device. For the price and the ease of use and integration, I am very happy with it. I only wish it had a chargeable feature to go alongside it to make it truly portable but I guess Amazon has other devices which cater to that need.I really haven't used the offerings from google and apple in this category so will not compare but just for itself, this device is a charm."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Decent product, but has many software bugs... Hope they are fixed in the future.",4.0,"Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good Sound Quality.,5.0,"Sound Quality was unexpected from such a small device with a single small speaker. I enjoy FM radio (through skill) everyday. This is very useful as analog FM reception in our area is very bad. Through skills it reminds me of my medication.  Command detection is mostly accurate. But when searching for music, it plays wrong songs at times may be because of the very limited music collection with amazon. Pairing with a second Bluetooth speaker using ""discover"" command is not working unless you remove the already paired device using Alexa app. I wish the alarms and reminders had user programmable/uploadable bells/voices as there is only one sound in the alarm settings."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),My first smart speaker,5.0,1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not for all. Suits teens best.,2.0,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.Update: January 10, 2021Almost two years since purchaseThe device is still as good as it was when bought. However, it seems Amazon has made no efforts to improve their music libraries. Their focus is still only to cater to the youth, not those who love soft soulful music. When I ask Alexa to play songs of Md. Rafi, for example, she will only play noisy ones like ""Chaahe koyi mujhe jungle kahe..."". She will never include songs like ""Ik haseen shaam ko dil mera kho gayaa..."" even if the song is available in Amazon Music. The Amazon team thinks only college goers listen to its music. This is one of the reasons why I can not recommend Amazon's voice assisted speakers to friends."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa Echo dot review,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Sound quality is good,fast response,easy to use.it is a good product and for those who are not much aware about the technology they can also operate easily.you can listen news and if you are feeling bored alexa can tell you good jokes.i m also using wipro smart bulb with Alexa and it is working awesome.i found only one issue sometimes alexa does not respond I think because when we give command from long distance I mean because of mic but overall good product."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa with lot of restriction,1.0,"It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app's missing in window computer .if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .With RegardsRavishankar"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Somewhat disappointed,3.0,"Excellent service provided by the device.. Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it’s only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV’s in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product.."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Expensive Smart Speaker,2.0,"Expensive, Smart speaker works only when plugged in. Bluetooth V2.0 is very old dur to this audio is very poor, sound becomes very low. No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device. Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound. Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad. You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you - voice sensor is poor. On full volume Alexa will not recognise your command."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),In love with it,4.0,"My only disappointment is that it does not have battery and when power goes off it dies.Sound quality is very good, good bass but not like woofer.It can be used as Bluetooth speaker. But not sure if Bluetooth earphones works with it. Will update about it later."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Too much hype,2.0,"This review is especially for those sitting on the fence .I’ve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically .(the full intercom) . It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing. Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google. The sound is natural but artificially natural, a little muffled as well.The app is poor. What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer. Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that much."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Go for Google home instead,1.0,"Better go for Google home..- cannnot make/accept phone calls (only Alexa calls)- cannot place orders on prime now- connected to Samsung smart TV via smart things skill and it can only do basic control like on/off,volume control.-technical customer care is not that good for any support issue.Free Wipro smart light isn't really smart..once power resumes after a power cut you need to switch it off again via app/Alexa.Only worthy use of echo is unlimited music from Amazon music."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not happy with Amazon service,2.0,"I was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours. Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 7.05pm evening and I call from them on 7.06pm which was amazing and prompt service. The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn't complete the set up process. I was completely surprised & confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service. I was happy with customers service not with Amazon service"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),😤 After 3 months!👇🏻,4.0,"After 3 months here are the things which I found.Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.I have started to get few bugs or software issue.Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, 'sorry, I don't know that.'Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.After command it doesn't follow.Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can't hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Voice recognition/understanding not that good as it's build,4.0,"The Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than it's predecessor. The sound quality is improved, however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of it's manufacturer or would say the developers rather. The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Google home is nothing infront of this,5.0,"So i know why you guys are here for.Omg why should i buy amazon echo instead of google home??So good for you here's the answer.I'll not tell you about things you know and everyone's talking about like it's mic and speakers are awsome, it's very localised etc.I'll tell you why you need this if you want this for home.1. This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room😝)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don't have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6. If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights. so you don't have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google home.(you need multiple echo devices for this as obvious)So forgot about google home and just buy it."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),I Gave 4 out of 5 Star,4.0,"This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Muffled Alexa voice,3.0,Speaker is good for news and music to some extent But it is worst when Alexa speaks. She sounds muffled and its difficult to understand especially when fan or ac is on The Equalizer wud not manage Alexa's speech it's only for news music etc. Very inconvenientI have 3 echo devices and homepod but Alexa is supercool as an assistant. Problem is only with echo dot 3rd gen. You can go for better echo models. I wud recommend to test it out first then make a buying decision
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),unique product,5.0,Product is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregards

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Worst quality packaging materials,1.0,I brought two speakers on a sale. Waited for a few months to install when we move to our new home. And placed them in a cardboard box which contains a lot of cardboard boxes of electronics. Termites are attracted to the amazon echo boxes and made a mess and ate almost all the three echo dot boxes. And most interestingly the remaining boxes are stood firm. I don't know what to do now. Please help me Amazon.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good device for the price,4.0,Great service at a great price. Thank you Amazon.The voice recognition is pretty good. But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent. Not really so great. You can take it around with you wherever you go. We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall. The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),This is like fishing by Amazon.

After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is, this is for prime members.Expect whether report this device don't deliver anything.Planning to return it tomorrow.Please don't get into traps like this.Today they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some money.Thanks Amazon for trapping me.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),A big flaw for indian market,1.0,"Using a proprietry power connector for power supply is a big flaw for indian market, where power outage is common, I have my speakers and modem connected with a ups and i am forced to keep alexa at the same place where it doesnt pickup my voice most of the time. A Micro usb port would have been better. I can connect a powerbank to it to make this device portable. In that sense i think google mini is better"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),MUST BUY PRODUCT,4.0,"If you’re in the market for a cheap wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of the best smart speakers on the market for you – even better than the Google Home Mini in terms of call quality and music playback."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Bluetooth connection get disconnected automatically,4.0,"Scenario:Connect your iPhone11 with JBL Go and Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation via blue toothBoth device should be connected.

The problem is not observedIf only Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation only connected to the phone everything works fineThe same problem is not observed with iPad Mini and Android phone"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Review after 2.5 months usage. It's a great purchase for me.,5.0,"I felt the sound quality is great at the price of 2249 during sale. The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation,  excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Way to go.,3.0,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.Pros:1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.Cons:1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.2. Misses the command now and then.3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Distorted sound,2.0,"Within 3 months of purchasing the sound has begun to distort, even at 5 or 6 level I can here unusual sound. I don't know what to do. My return window is already closed.Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good speaker for songs only.,4.0,"I'm very happy with my purchase.Initially it feels little bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it.Later on talking to Alexa becomes a part of your daily life.✅Things which I like the most are stated below:👍The sound quality is very good.👍You get good depth of sound.👍You can ask any random questions to Alexa.👍It can speak and understand Hindi and English languages.👍It does play all musics from all languages.👍It can tell jokes.👍I also played KBC with Alexa.❌Things which I don't like are:👎Sometimes it is unable to understand what you said.👎Most of time Alexa reply ""Sorry"" because she don't know the answers of our command/questions.👎It is a good music player but poor assistant.👎It plays certain songs again and again and doesn't let you skip.👎You have to set a play list in your phone or device from which you are operating Alexa. Otherwise you will keep on saying ""Alexa play this song. Alexa play that song.""👎If you won't set any playlist it will stop after every song.👎It is not battery powered.👎has to be kept plugged in all the time."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa is not efficient to play any malayalam songs,1.0,"Writing again since I am totally unsatisfied with Alexa and it became a useless item for me . Unable to add skills pertaining to choice of music . When i bought Alexa, lot of expectations , but it is not at all impressive on various areas, like when I ask Alexa to play malayalam songs , based on movies,singers,by song name, it is always gives an answer sorry I could not see any song. Same stands with Tamil and to an extend hindi songs as well.Google Home is much smarter and better choice than Aelxa. I strongly suggest if Amazon is not fixing this basic issues and needs of many in India, you may always got a better option 'Google Home'."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Very bad product.. cracking sound after six maonths of usage.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I used hardly six months and getting crack sound from speaker. It happened to couple of other friends too. And service is very pathetic. I have booked service and no one called me back. Better to go for Google one which is very reliable. This is not for long term usage. Amazon making fools with duplicate products."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),The future is now!,5.0,"Simply great product. Well built and very worth it. The voice recognition is great and works as intended most of the time. It keeps getting better as you use it. The sound really surprised me for its size. It's definately not a premium sound but it's still very bassy and loud, and full volume there is noticible disturbunce. The home automation part is what really makes this worth it though. I have my lights, tv and ac connected (using oakter remote) and ofcourse it's also an alarm, an intercom, a music player, a smart assistant and so much more. Life changing tech this is. I also like that you can command it in hindi and english. The conversations to be had are funny and almost natural. Software updates can/should make it even better. Wish it also had battery back up though, that's its biggest flaw. Soon I'll connect many other electronics in my house to alexa by way of smart switches."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Magical experience and awesome product no doubt,5.0,What a product.. U think of a song and say it.. Alexa actually can play the exact song to the 100% accuracy.Sound quality is awesome with this small sized powerpack. Romantic and slow songs music are just lovable. Although if u like badhash or some hip hop music. U can use an additonal speaker and connect this to it..Mics are quite sensitive and can take orders from other room. Only at high volume u need to yell still not but a concern though.Product build quality excellent.Just an amazing product. U will sure love it.Day 10 and still exploring it. My kid loves to interact with it and ask almost anything and he is excited.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Voice recognition is not good,3.0,I was writing this review after three weeks of usage. I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable device.I dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time it's not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytime.Alexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working well.My rating for this product will be 2.5/5
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Do not ever buy this,1.0,"Dont fall for this. Though it feels good when it plays few songs however in most of the cases it wont recognize your voice. Also, at high volumes, you will keep on shouting Alexa, Alexa and it wont hear you.Just a stupid toy, may be for kids"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Do not By Any Amazon product,1.0,Its a absolutely cheating for the customer. If we buy any amazon product . Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also. In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app. No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa. If anybody want to amazon Alexa . Go For GOOGLE HOME. Its have everything. And also free cost for all App
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Ok,3.0,"Not happy it's an ok product  as it does not catch things fast, to add on Amazon prime would have worked better if it sinks in with you tube and Google along with added new features ( off old and new).Another annoying thing is it keeps giving the entire description (ex - song or any movie ) which cannot be put off.It's goes not have want I want."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Bad product,1.0,It worked good for about a month. But after that it started hanging. Now most of the times it doesn't recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music. Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation. I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline. Total waste of money.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Amazing sound quality. Amazing features. Slight issue with connectivity,5.0,Pros.1. Sound quality considering its compact design2. Compact. Box is also pretty small hence good to carry even when you travel.3. Great features with lot of additional apps or featured addons4.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Great as a Smart Hub and Voice Assistant,5.0,"I did a lot of research and after much deliberation, I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest. I have to say, I am totally loving this. I have connected it to my Smart TV, Fire TV, Wipro Bulbs, Camera and Smart Sockets. Overall, I am satisfied and the device is working as expected. The only minus point is that the power cable is using old-style pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standard."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Unrelated but necessary to know about AMAZON'S after sale and warranty service. Be warned.,1.0,"This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem ."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Great for Kids!,5.0,"My Nephew is in love with it. At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions. Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now, we don't get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now. Some we knew some we had to research. Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himself.Update:I ordered second one for my another nephew's bday. Its great product to introduce technology to the kids."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Great product with nice feature but repair of this product is not possible in India,4.0,"The product is really good and works fine as per the expectation.Though the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power, speaker of my device got damaged. Then I had sent it for repair but in india they can't open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months. Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault. Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India.  Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circle."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Device is great but I GOT BORED!,4.0,"This is a good device (or should I say a Toy). It works exactly as promised. So, no complaints over there.BUT,This is more like a toy to me. The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house. I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge. I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote. I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the same.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY (1 WEEK IN MY CASE) GET BORED WITH THIS TOY."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"When it comes to automation,  this device is going to be helpful for beginners",4.0,This is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device.  The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly. Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity. The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesn't respond when we call Alexa
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),A perfect companion,5.0,"I love my echo dot device. There some things, which are really good like whisper command. I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don’t want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch 🙄.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it’s shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability. It fits in my bag so conveniently  just ignore the dangling cable."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Output via 3.5mm jack is very poor,2.0,"I just don't want to integrate it with anything in my house as it doesn't sound clear via built in speaker and 3.5mm output jack, I brought it for listening music, podcast and GK but due to poor audio clarity it is still not in plugged in state in my home, it is just sitting on table without it's adapter plugged in."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),WRONG INFORMATION about Echo Dot,1.0,"I ordered this product because it shows in web description as ""Echo Dot (3rd Gen)"".But when I connected to it with my alexa app, it shows Echo Dot ""2nd Gen"" instead of ""3rd Gen"".I am feeling like cheated."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Read full review please,2.0,"Wnna buy only smart speaker--googleWnna get an amazon atmosphere(prime,amazon music,fire tv etc,)--alexaFor a smart speaker its not that smart, nothing works without activating a skill and skills set (trust me not that great, sukhaa pada h yaar) if you only want a smart speaker 🔊 and you are heavily invested in amazon prime and fire tv stick like gadgets and you have other smart compatible devices and you need the help of amazon services very often only then go for it. Until used with amazon family its good but, if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy. Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of google"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Awesome product,5.0,"My son has been asking for a long time. However we weren't buying. This time, we decided to buy. It's an awesome product. we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty. It's picks up right songs with minimal inputs.We have integrated it with fire stick also.No regrets...I recommend a buy ...Happy Alexaing :)"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Alexa, do I need you?",3.0,"I truly don’t see the point behind Alexa or any smart speaker for that matter.I finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right, there’s nothing great about a smart speaker.There’s nothing much you can do with it and the charm & novelty wears off quite soon. More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadget.Don’t get me wrong, the product is good but I really don’t see its utility. Buy with your own wisdom & utility."

 I have been using it since years.Perfect home smart speaker. Sounds crisp and listens carefullyPair a couple of them and get the awesome stereo effect as well .Can be a smart speaker in kitchen , working desk stereo , bed side night audio device. You name it it delivers.Loved this product through out the usage"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good as a novelty for kids,1.0,"Horrible music sound. Only good for speeches or weather reports, not for music. Bluetooth connectivity is a pain if you have multiple devices. Stationary use only (no battery). If you go and plug in another room, for example from living room to bedroom you have to start connectivity again from scratch. Alexa software is ages behind Google voice. I am returning this product. Good for a novelty, although you can get better items to show off for that price. Could not even recognize Gurgaon. Don’t be fooled by 3rd generation... just some more fancy lights. If the price drops after you buy it and take it somewhere else. You are basically left with price difference hanging around your neck! Rip off. Great for kids though!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Read this while you decide,5.0,"The room has converted into a smart home. But it is a costly affair. First of all you need a wifi connection then you need all smart acessories or appliances to pair with Alexa such as Smart Plug, Smart Bulb, IR Blaster(require in case of non-smart appliance like AC). Overall it gives an esteem feeling. The echo dot 3 is good. But I expected a beter sound from the device."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Cheated and worst pick up service,2.0,"I got a faulty product. The lights were on for 5 mins..then all went off..there was no orange light...totally dissatisfied in 30 mins....Return Status: I applied for return on the same day that the product was delivered. The next day, i got a sms stating pick time was scheduled between 7 am to 7 pm which was ridiculous. Would the Amazon pickup service want someone to be in home for the whole day, just for receiving the pick up guy? I waited till 3pm and left for other imp service. Had an sms sent at the morning hrs about the approx pickup time, it would have been more meaningful. Totally, cheating and lethargic."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Buy it without second thought.,5.0,"This is one of the best speakers you will get own. The response is improving everyday and the skills are polished continuously. Don't go by the reviews of negetive people as they have a bad accent and then blame it on the speaker, however Hindi is also supported now.Just buy it when you get a deal as I got a free bulb with it.You have to spend a little if you want to be at par with the technology. Since Jio Savan is fully supported you therefore need not get the prime membership in case that is what you are afraid of."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Brilliant Product,5.0,"I got this one during the Prime day sale. I have used this for a month now and below is my review.Pros:1. Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3.  Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say ""Alexa"" 2 times.  Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),It's totally worth it.,5.0,"I bought it for 3500 for 2 echo dots and 1 bulb. For this price its totally worth it. I really enjoyed using it and my sis has a toddler who is easily pacified using alexa light controls and songs (we have bought costlier toys but it's alexa who mostly saves the day). So for my home, It already did more than I paid for.😌😌😌"

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Few improvements needed,3.0,"They need to provide battery backup so that we can carry it anywhere.It needs to play songs randomly also like YouTube, instead of asking it to play.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Totally Amazed,5.0,"This is just awesome.There are so many things we can do with this device and that made me wonder that why this is so cheap.I got a smart bulb with the device in just 2500 rs.Now I control my bluetooth speaker, my tv(firestick) and my bedroom light with my voice commands.This is fun for my 4 years old kid too and Alexa tell stories to him.The voice recognition is very good and the proof is that even my kid's commands Alexa recognise."

Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that's keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for music"

I remember the small piano or such devices our parents used to give us when we were 6 years old. Whatever you ask it has only few stereotype answers. Playing a desired song is the most irritating part. It never knows what you want to play, instead it plays some fixed song list no matter what you asked her play. Also it also doesn't have songs with filters such as genere, mood etc. My opinion ? DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.. your mobile is far useful to do things you expect Alexa can ..."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Pros and cons,3.0,Pros1. It explains Vocabulary2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music ) Cons1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),My first Smart Speaker,5.0,Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7. Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain you.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Better than Google home mini at cost of Rs. 3000,5.0,"Best home usable device for entertainment.. If you are thinking to buy it or not, then I'm sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it. I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs.3000 during discount period. So, wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs.3000 or below.Currently, it is Rs. 3500 but wait and I""'m sure that it will go down to Rs.3000 within a 1 or 1.5 month. Just wait and check regularly the price of this product (check daily atleast once).If you thinking to buy google home mini, then don't buy at all, I've experienced both. Echo dot is thousand times better that it. Google home mini don't recogine your voice well and can't perform e-commercial and play games activities."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Its a great choice if its not a plug n play device.,4.0,"Everything looks good.sound quality and responsiveness to commands are perfect.Only negative is its a plug n play device ,in that price they should have provided battery in it and then we can carry everywhere we want with us and use it as a absolute bluetooth smart device.thats why im giving 4 star rating.whenver power is off or the supply stopped by turning the switch off by someone, u need to setup again for alexa dot to work, its such a hectic and irritating process and once it setup you cant move this device to someother place without turning the power supply off and need to reconnect the device."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Great product, but still quite dumb",4.0,"Amazon echo dot is a great product in terms of its sound quality and overall entertainment value. But for practical use it is still quite dumb. For Indians we definitely need to set English and Hindi together. Also many common things it does in a dumbest way. Many Indian songs it doesn't understand correctly. Variations in news, scores, horoscopes, weather are just missing.Long way to go for this technology. In many ways google assistant is better. I hope that same device should allow marriage of all the technologies in this field."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Overrated product,3.0,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs 😕😕, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless 🙄🙄🙄. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.If you earn Luke crazy money, go for it... It's good for show off. However, if you are that person who thinks before buying, DON'T. BUY. IT. Pls, save your money for better things."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Quality product with a variety of uses,5.0,Echo Dot 3rd gen is an absolutely amazing device. It works as expected and has great amount of features. Th sound signature is good and Alexa works 100pc of the time. Although there is room for improvement in voice recognition when there is too much noise in the room or fan is running and search results of Alexa also needs some improvements. Overall a great product at good price

Defected product received in Imphal,Manipur.",1.0,"This is my second purchase, the first one was bought in Noida. It was great. But this one, I got it delivered in Imphal, Manipur. The bass of the speaker is distorted, the sound is distorted. It is nowhere as good as the one I got it in Noida. Is Amazon trying to sell defected products in the north-east or something? It takes longer than usual to reach Imphal even tho I have a prime membership, on top of that, you're selling us defected products. Shameful. Now I'll have to wait for 10-15 days for it to get replaced. With the lockdown and all, who knows how longer it'll take. Extremely disappointed."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),BEST for SMART Homes.,5.0,"You can buy it with no hesitation. But my suggestion is the people who are looking to or having a SMART HOME like everything in your house is automated with Voice command it's good for you. And for the normal houses it's just act like a Bluetooth Speaker that's it somewhere around in a corner laying in your house. If you want to BUY it first convert your house like smart bulbs, tubelights, android TV, remote enabled fans, Ac's. Normal houses just a speaker that you can talk when bored for entertainment."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Stop bluetooth announcement,3.0,"The most frustrating feature of Alexa is the annoying announcement while connecting to Bluetooth. it does every time when it connects with the device and there is no way to disable it. People have been crying for years, while Amazon is not listening.Other than that it is much better in comparison to google home mini. In comparison voice quality and search too."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Sound quality good,3.0,"Eco dot 3rd gen . Some time not recognise conamds and skills.. company claim fully smart speaker. But when you use eco dot 3rd gen you realise .. is this not a fully smart speaker.. hardware is good but software is not up to the mark .. need more updates.. link with maps ... Some time then i ask ""where is Mathura"" answere correct...but when i say ""how i go Mathura"" no route find by alexa eco dot 3rd gen.... More updates needed....may be...😊"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good product,4.0,"I had Google donut but it failed miserably, Echo dot is much better ...however it doesnt recognize some questions. But nevertheless good device. But the smart bulb I got with it is very very tough to adjust with it through app, still havent been able to do it as the bulb instructions arent veryclear"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Worst software with best speaker,1.0,"I am not criticizing this product but I hope it helps to improve the quality in future.The speaker quality is very good I will give 6 star out of 5 stars..but the question understanding ability is very very very worst.. if any question asked it gives irrelevant answers..It answers only for simple qustions like what's time, what's my name like that 🤦If I want to play desired songs in local language I has to tell alexa for atleast 5 to 10 times to understand to get exact song 🤦🤦But I am not returning this product back because I like the audio output sound very much."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good hardware. Software leaves much to be desired.,4.0,"I have both Google Home and Alexa.Alexa works better with smart devices. It responds much quicker to requests on turning light on/off compared to GHome, which clearly lags.However, Alexa lags GHome on answering questions and playing music. When asked to play music, it frequently responds with ""Saavn is not available in your region"" while playing Saavn other times. Also it's response to natural language questions is behind GHome.Speaker quality great. Speaker sensitivity excellent-it catches the wake word even when spoken from a distance. GHome lags here."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good. No Battery power. No charm,3.0,Like.Product is good. Integration with Amazon music is good.DislikeNo battery back up. So it occupies the power point. Not portable as well. Major disadvantage for the price paid. The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaper.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),A very handy tool in a busy life.,5.0,"A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than 'Google Home' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which ""for my taste"" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa understanding capacity is reduced.,3.0,Alexa doesn't understand the commands properly.I ask to Play Sainyoo Nee it Plays Sainya Ve.I ask to Play. It plays some other languages radio station which we don't understand.It is not able to recognise the Wipro Bulb.I am fed up with Alexa. I want to return it back. If Possible.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Good product, value for money",5.0,"Product is good, after using for a month, felt bad, I should have gone to 4th generation, few features are missing in it, just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too, to listen for some downloaded songs also. All features are good and working well, HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),I didn't like the sound signature,3.0,"I didn't like the sound signature, I had to reduce the Bass to 0 and mid and treble to 10 to make it suit my ears. The Alexa app is very sluggish. It's very well built, can recognise voice from distance, options are less as compared to google assistant."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Amazing Smart Speaker & Superb Audio Quality.,5.0,"Best Smart Speaker I have bought , Got it a very good price during Amazon Great Indian Festival, got it for around Rs 2200 along with Smart Led Buld.Pros :1. Very Good build quality.2. Superb Design3. Amazing Audio Quality4. Very good audio songs collection.5. Helps is various smart task like controlling smart lights at home.Cons :1. Not portable like a Bluetooth speaker as it requires power and internet.Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I can recommend this if you are someone looking for a smart speaker with good sound quality."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Please Read before buying,1.0,"Please note you will enjoy this device only when you will be prime member of Amazon (1000 k/year).Otherwise it's very bad after few days. Initially you will enjoy voice command, but it's not accurate and limited. So you will want to control it from mobile. But it's only possible to prime members."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Dont expect it to do wonders, its needs a other 10 yrs of work",3.0,"Well, good for kids but for the most part AI needs huge amount of work, dont expect smartness like google, it more of bluetooth speaker and there are better options available in this price range. My daughter likes to play around with Alexa with all kinds of unusual questions. Decided to keep it"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Don't buy,1.0,"After one year of useless use: They are just making customer fool by selling a box useful with only Amazon Prime .. U cannot use hotatar, Sony liv, ganna, wynk .. Nothing as no app/skill supported .. I am regretting to buy such cheap, useless dumb box .. And with Alexa, u will have headache as she don't know anything.. Best is Google by miles"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Sound gets distorted at higher volumes.,3.0,It's versatile in the sense that everyone at home can play almost whatever they like. But most songs available on Amazon music are not recognized by voice commands. You need to search them on phone and then cast on the speaker. Also I think a wall mount should be included in the package.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Worth every penny,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bought the entire thing in less than 4.5k whole room is automated now tv, ac, lights, switchesthings I am using- Alexa echo dot 3- Amazon smart plug 6a- Chroma wifi IR remote (tv/ac)- Wipro garnet RGB 12wLooking forward  to adding more devices"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa features - understanding mechanism,4.0,"#1) Alexa doesn't have full feature:  1.1) struggles to have the reminder or reminder doesn't works at all.  1.2) doesn't remember the play list  1.3) doesn't store multiple play list or facing problem to retrieve multiple playlist.  1.4) cldn't find the multi-language recognition feature/skill (eg: Tamil)#2) As usual issue with pay-on-delivery :  Courier shows resistance on Pay on delivery by cash.  Otherwise, everything is perfect by quality and delivery."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Best in this price range,5.0,"I've been using it for 2 months now, working totally fine. Voice quality and volume is really great comparing with its size. Voice recognition is good. Doesn't work without wifi. Best for home use, bluetooth connectivity is seemless. If you love to listen music and use AI to schedule meetings, alarms, listen to news, this one is for you. It doesn't have a battery, runs only on electricity. In this price range, this is the best product"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not good for zoom calls,3.0,"I have purchased this for my kids class, but it always drops the voice in between and speaker is not compatible with zoom. We expect at least voice in the zoom call should be fine, but it isn't. it is not the internet or bandwidth problem, because I have 100Mbps and 5G WiFi connectivity. If you are going for meetings I would recommend to go with another product."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),A good entry level smart Speaker bought @2k,5.0,"A bit suprised by how lpud the speaker is, voice recognition is good with the fan on at full speed.Tried using an RCA to Aux to connect this to an old Sony BluRay. This allowed me to play songs from my phone on the old Sony, but frankly the audio could be way louder and clearer.The Wipro smart bulb works without issues."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Very poor experience. AI is bad no developed learning, graduate student intern product.",2.0,"Sound/audio quality is much better than other competitors but when it comes to AI, very poor AI, looks like it's not learning over the time, it just follow simple command which graduate guy can implement. If it's only for speaker then go for some other good brands. Very poor integration with mobile app, fire stick. Didn't find any module to understand it. Very important for my family which is do not support Marathi regional language and do not interpret marathi sonngs very clearly, neither Marathi names."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Review after one month uses.,3.0,"Feature wise review.1. Sound quality - 5 star (loud and clear).2. Voice recognition - 43. Alexa Intergration - 34. Smart features - 3.55. Alexa Skills - 2.5There is a lot of improvement neede in terms of Alexa skills as it doesn't work well in most of the scenario such as Alexa is not able to give you search results based on your exact location. In one scenario, I was searching for Dominos to check its efficiency, It gave me the nearest result which was not even in my city, even though my wifi, gps was ON and the location was well marked on google maps as well."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Otp based delivery is worst..  worst ever application to reach u..,1.0,Worst ever delivery experiance from amazon..your otp based delivery is the worst thing. Getting frustrated by waiting for otp after delivery...especially at times of mobile network failures...no msg came for otp.... no option to re send the otp.. no instant customer care number to contact... user enemy application... if your algorithm fails to satisfy our customer needs give us an alternate to reach your customer care....  here after i wont use amazon for purchasing any thing..... give us alernative if your algorithm fails...  dont make us fools  by your algorithm  rules... one star for makes us frustrated by your delivery rules..
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Small and Powerful.,5.0,"It's quite a simple, yet powerful device. While the voice recognition system still needs to improve. The range of microphones is wide and it wakes up on calling, instantly, most of the time. The speaker quality is good and pairing two of the for a stereo configuration will make it much better. Alexa works well as advertised and with additional skills, it can become better. Would love to see more regional language officially supported as it's right now restricted to Hindi only."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa lost peoples interest!!,1.0,"Its not good as i thought about it.Even its not working according to my expectations.Whenever i ask or ordered somethingAlexa didn't perform its 100% even its doesn't know some common locations or alexa doesn't know about very common songs singer n album's its totally worthless in this task nd this is the biggest issues i faced with alexa and the last thing is alexa doesn't satisfied my expectations 😑😐So its totally up to you guys either you improved its skills or take my suggestion,queries nd issues lightlyIt depends on you guys,you take this note as my humble request or a joke but seriously its not a joke 😇😇I am Your one of the well wisher not a judge 😊"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Long way to go Alexa,2.0,"Pros1. Sound Quality Superb,2. device looks great stylish.3. Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad. Dim the light, play animal sound, so on. But world does not end here.Cons1. Integration with other device poor and take lot of time. Software and app working is poor.2. Voice recognition - Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5. Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. 😀3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.4. Every time we have keep for charging.5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won't feel worth. As a speaker only yes it is.At last Good affords by Amazon but long way to go."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Connectivity Issue Everytime with Distorted Sound.,2.0,"I purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020. Since, April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone, the sound that comes from it is distorted.And then I asked for help from amazon. They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Alexa, I am Impressed 😄👍🔥🙏",5.0,"Excellent device! After Fire TV Stick this is my 2nd Amazon made smart device & it once again surprises me. Sound quality is good enough. Voice recognition also works great. Only drawback is there is no Spotify integration, So I have to depend on Amazon Music/Jiosaavan which are both crap. Except that it's a great smart little device through which you can elaborate your smart life quite amazingly."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Superb and convenient.,5.0,Superb product. Easy to setup and so convenient to use. I've set it up to link to my Spotify account so you get even a larger database if music with Prime music and Spotify combined.The sound quality surprised me. I have many other portable speakers but this one is one of the better ones.GO FOR IT.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good buy if price is around 2000,4.0,I bought this in offer in 2290. I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size. The voice recognition is good. Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg. I don't think it would have been a good buy if bought above this price.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Must have for Music.,5.0,We have been using Echo dot for playing Music with Kids around. It becomes easier to play songs without have to look out for the Phone. So less screen time in front of Kids and more family time.Speaker volume is good for hall. Good for in-house get-together.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Excellent product. Loud speakers,5.0,I have been using it for almost 5 months and till now I don't have any problem with it.It recognises most of the commands give to it. It surfs information from Google to give accurate answers.I liked that it's speakers are very loud and clear sound quality.Works excellent for both Hindi and English commands.Not much difference between echo dot 3rd generation and 4th generation.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good hardware but poor software,5.0,"Its one of the finest smart speaker in indian market nd amazon prime 999rs per year subscription gives more benefits with music, video,etc When it comes to hardware it hav good sound which fills one smal room. Echo support more smart accessories thn google home nd apple homepod thats big thumbs up for Echo👍🏼 When it comes to software its lacks so much features. Google home ll give you more accurate answers and follw up conservation. Alexa properly dnt deals with follow up multiple questions. Amazon music dnt have more collections lik spotify, wynk. So overall good hardware with poor software. Needs to improve more in software. You need to plug in al the time because it does not come with battery option."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Don't respond to commands even buttons not working,1.0,I bought it 2 days backI turn off charging during night when I plug again in morning it is taking time to connect and after some time it stops responding to commands and also it won't work with button also then I have to restart 2 times minimum
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Does not run on battery,1.0,Not mentioned in the description that it does not run on battery. So won't work when travelling unless connected to a plug point. It only runs on the power adapter. Returning it.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good toy for kids,4.0,"All is good with this device, don't understand how tough it would have been to integrate a battery into it. Worse, the power adapter is not industry standard Micro-USB or Type C. Amazon's way of making people dependent on their proprietary power adapter, and eliminating chance of powering it with a power bank"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Very good product,3.0,"It is very good but not searching like Google, maximum time reply that I don't know....limited news & radio station.. More improvement required. If you want to know about some one, alexa reply ""don't know"" but Google always tell about that."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Review after 3 months of usage.....,4.0,"This is a fully honest review...............Ok, Echo Dot Is a great smart speaker with great abilitiesprosIt can control almost every smart home deviceSpeaker Quality is greathave hundreds of skillsspeaks Hindi as wellcan buy products from amazonMic is really awesome, can hear you from another roomA really good feature, you can talk to her in Hindi and English at the same time! like, you gave a command in English and you can give the next command in Hindi!her voice is better than google assistantcoordinates wellGood for children as wellcan control other Alexa devices as wellConssome times she does not wake up, after saying the wake-up word 2 or 3 times then she wake upI don't know why they removed the Zomato skill, it was a good skillsometimes she listens wrongStarsAlexa-4Speaker-5Coordination-5Mic-5Build Quality-3.5skills-4.5smart home control-5waking up-3understanding-4Overall review--A great smart speaker but I will suggest buying an Echo instead of Echo DotThat's all Folks!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Awesome but kinda lacking,4.0,"The product is really good, dont judge the sound quality by its size, its heavily boosted bass makes us go crazy for the song, voice recognition is great even during noisy conditions one thing that it lacks is the portability it needs a power source connected to a socket all the time but for this price point there are real good Bluetooth speakers hence if Amazon could come up with wireless echo speaker it would be really good, I also bought the wipro bulb with the combo ajd integrated it with echo dot and it it awesome. You can change brightness colour preset modes jist with your voice but it requires the bulb and echo dot to be connected to the same network all the time"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good but needs lots of improvements to match google assistant or Siri,2.0,"When I first brought this product I loved this but after 2 months of use I had to reset it as it could not connect to internet and to set-up for 2nd time it took me 2 hours as really could not connect to internet.The main problem for this device is, if there is no internet then its a dumb box, could not do anything. This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition. Hoping Amazon will improve its AI features a lot like google or Siri."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa require some improvement and need to speed up to Google Assistance,5.0,"Nice one I am enjoying but the voice recognition still required to be improved by Amazon as some time it recognises u but and some time it doesn't. But some where I felt still Alexa required to improve than Google Assistance, as Google is much faster and much informative then Alexa, as many times it says sorry I don't know this."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good for Alexa talk not mainly for music,4.0,"Ya i like it's very much but my point of view is it's bit expensive to buy it for those planning to listen music it serves best with talking to alexa and AI stuff but when you listen music or just watch movie in laptop connected to it's not upto the mark you will get disappointed but for AI it's good ,may be its next gen have enough bass and sound for songs but definitely not this one , this one has more crisp voice which is very good while talking with alexa."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Echo Dot Sucks. BIG TIME.,1.0,"Alexa needs some real upgrade in general. As for the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, VERY POOR Voice Recognition. I literally have to yell for Alexa to listen. Be it cranking the volume, changing tracks, or anything whatsoever. Had quite some expectations since I proudly own a fire stick. Even after buying the speaker (which I bought mainly for the purpose so that all my favorite music could come in handy), I still prefer to play music on my TV than on my speaker. I mean why buy a speaker if you can't even play music on it without a fuss. Overall, it's a big NO. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Bought two, very happy and satisfief",5.0,I bought echo dot 3rd gen and was so happy with it that I bought echo input s week after. The ease of using without the phone or laptop is great. The sound is good enough. Obviously it cannot compare with big standalone speaker. I have connected the dot to my big speakers and using input in any room I want because it is portable
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),The casting with amazon music is not proper,3.0,When we cast amazon music with exhi it recognises only straight forward songs. No podcast or stations are played in echo. And it even does not recognise podcast through voice. The alexa app is also too slow  Better to go for google
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Only WiFi😖,4.0,"Hi guys if u have Wi-Fi in your house only than... Buy it or else.... U need to use your phones hotspot and connect .... And one.... More thing is u need to plug it everytime u can't take it and roam lik other Bluetooth... Speaker's..... These are cons of this, I hope Amazon bring solution for.... This.. ,,, rest everything is fine..."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Needy and addictive, makes you lazy 🤣",5.0,"Have issues of unresponsive behaviour rarely  and needs a restart for immediate use or had to wait few minutes, mine works 24*7 so may be that's an issue? This is my second Echo and it's worth using at home if you have smart switches installed."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good product.,5.0,I was using google all along. Bought alexa for a variant. 3rd gen is good. Bass and treble are very nice in that product range. Overall loved the product. Got the product after one week of struggle and follow up with amazon. A very bitter experience in the last 8 years of mydealing with Amazon.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),BUYING ALEXA IS ONE OF THE MOST NICE DECISION I MADE IN 2020,4.0,"Alexa is great. For a bedroom or a living room, Alexa works like magic. I also got a light (Wifi enabled) from wipro along with Alexa as a package and it had works wonder for us.It understands Hindi, English and also talks with us when we are alone or lonely.You can also connect Alexa with your mobile using it as a Bluetooth speaker. It's a true fact that this version has to be plugged in all the time- but apart from this- its just GREAT! I loved it and a true fan of ALEXA!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Waste of money but thanks I got refund,1.0,"U can better buy some 500+ speaker. Bcuz I'm using kdm speaker. Its wireless, bluetooth speaker, pendrive & memory card can b used. If we put charge for 6-8hrs fully, thru our mobile bluetooth we can check charge percentage & it can b play for 3hrs more. For setting alarm r schedule program, songs etc Alexa not required. Alexa is totally waste, can't use without power, sngs restricted only with prime n few,"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),First step towards the future.,5.0,"Works great! Though it doesn't make anything significantly easier, it's a nice addition to ones room and also a good starting point to experience the future.Audible Suno is a superb bonus to this product. And also most used music services like gaana and jio saavn are free to use, which makes this very useful. Last bust not the least, it can easily revive the dying interest in you about the radio channels.But also be aware that you are signing up for some sort of compromise in your data privacy!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Issue in Alexa listing capability,1.0,"hi Team ,i  recently observed that the alexa is only listing when i am speaking loudly .  I found this issue when i used the other alexa device at my friend home . Please look into this as alexa is not listing when i am specking at normal pitch .My contact no :- 9654542266"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Useful 5 stars...But beware of privacy,5.0,Arrived very fast and in good condition.. Sound very clear compared to mobile speakers..The Alexa app in google play has bugs..I had to reinstall Alexa app to change the wake word.. .Very useful..Helps in saving time...Only Concern is privacy...Note: Even mute button does not stop recording...Only way is to turn off the switch to safeguard privacy when in important conversations or when not in use...
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Excellent product,5.0,"I bought it in 2019 during Amazon festival offer, worth for the money.I have set the alarm in morning to play suprabatha and devotional songs, so I wake up hearing that.I use it to control my Wipro WiFi light and batten. I can even ask it to switch specific channel on my Airtel Xtrem set up box.Excellent device."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Sound quality is worst.,1.0,"Didn't like the sound quality, it's very hard to hear what Alexa speaks. Tried every settings, nothing worked.I now love my Google home more, such a sharp sound for any room. Amazon could have focused on the speakers quality."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Voce recognition is impressive. However, a lot is expected at the moment.",4.0,"Impressive:1. Easy command recognition from a child of three years old.2. Good interpretation of the command, per se.Expectations:1. Acceptance of English and Hindi command simultaneously.2. Offering choices of singers when a particular song is sung by many artists. At present, it always starts with the same artist.3. Offering choices of different starting points and sequences. E.g. for a command of ""Bhajan"" or ""instrumental lullabies"" it starts with the same song/music and proceeds with the same sequence. Soon it becomes monotonous. This needs improvement4. Identifying voices of the members of the family and offering their types of music. With its excellent ability of identifying voice it seems to be easy to recognize and remember voice by names of the family members (and the rest by guest). Remembering choices of the family members and offering music accordingly would be expected. Obviously, a reset option is must in such cases."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Amazon - best service ever,5.0,"Actually ,earlier it did not recognise my voice and I thought it is a device manufacturing issue but one thing I realised is that Amazon is far far better then any e- commerce company currently present in India. I mean I had put a bad review considering the unknowning fact about its language change in the device which I was not aware. I got a call from  Ireland call centre asking me about the issue and trust me guys I am really IMPRESSED by the way, Amazon customer service representatives handled the issue. So, to all who face an issue with regards to voice recognition in the particular device can request for help through customer care and you will be amazed with the help and later usage.From now I am a Amazon user, Bye Bye Flipkart-!!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Bugs in Eco dot.,3.0,"So many surprises after owning Alexa Eco dot.Too many bugs to recognize voice. Oftentimes does not understand the command and keep playing existing. Doesnt work reset command. Doesnt understand request from choice of songs to paly. Like if i wish to play specific album from Gana or Amazon music, it stick to play from Jio Savan and that is my horrible experience from Eco dot.Amazon team, pls fix such bugs and update else the customer reviews wont let you up."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Non-user friendly product,1.0,"Not user friendly, Frequently loose WiFi connection and Need long procedure and multiple steps to connect again.Secondly, I have raised complaints and ask for replacement. Amazon has registered complain and inform that pickup will be done within two days but nobody came and after two week removed my replacement request as well on Amazon site. It is my very bad experience with this product and amazon. I request Amazon should stop this product if unable to provide services."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Echo dot3 - An Average Smart speaker.,2.0,"The sound quality is very good as compared to previous generation . But Alexa assistants skills and integration with other smart devices(bluetooth) including Fire TV is very choppy.Alexa response is incorrect at times even after multiple repeats. It's wifi reception is not good, cannot work in weak  internet reception , Google home mini performs pretty well on these parameters."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Best Amazon product as on date,5.0,Just the uniqueness of the speaker and the ease of getting information and hearing songs.This is a must buy among all amazon products. Dont think twice just get it its awesome. Prerequisite is good wifi connection at home. Please note this speaker has to be connected to a powersource and the power block and cable is included n the box. Also amazon prime membership is a must. As I do have the above its everything I can ask for.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not upto mark(updated after few weeks usage).,2.0,Very very poor recognition. Even if i stay 1/2 meter away it's not recognising my voice. Sound quality is very good. Sometimes there is an issue of pairing even if i have speed network.After few weeks of usage I see that when i try connecting device with my mobile and use Bluetooth to play songz its breaking completely and vould not hear song properly. nit sure why i purchased this stupid amazon echo better i would have purchased google mini.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Never get bored if you are music lover (Just say play song name),4.0,Need to integrate with Kannada FM channels and news channels. It’s playing only ajtak news headlines.We don’t have option to change name of Alexa .If they add new feature it’s plus point for them.Apart from this for me it’s worth to buy below 2.5k.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Absolutely amazing AI product,5.0,This product is awesome. It recognizes what song you want to hear and plays it immediately from its vast library. Voice recognition is great. It can hear u from a distance even when songs are playing. I am loving it.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Few changes can improve overall experience.,4.0,"It needs a lot of improvements, we can not play songs directly from mobile to the echo dot, we can not browse songs through the apps( Gaana, saavn, prime music) and it only accepts voice commands for playing music. It would be better if we can type the song to be played as it doesn't recognize a lot of songs through voice commands. Needs high speed Internet to function properly. It does not recognize voice commands when a song is playing, so we can't mute it while a song is playing. Despite all these cons, it is still a pretty handy product."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Pathetic connectivity of the product,2.0,"I have been using Alexa Echo Dot from last one week.My house has a very good wifi connection but Alexa always has trouble connecting to the Internet.It understands what I say but never play songs. Most of the time, it does not understand clear English words as well.Alexa app shows the song, but Alexa does not understand the same keywords to play a song.Overall, I would not suggest the product at all. Do not waste your money on such useless product that most of time won't play music for you for which it is purchased."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not a fan,1.0,"Honestly not that great, not into the whole voice recording thing, would love to return it however the window is over.... The volume as an external speaker is not that great and it has to be plugged in to work"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),It's good but needs a better software update,4.0,Look it's good but there are still many questions which echo cannot answer something which Google home does very easily but overall it's good.  I can be improved if echo's software is updated.there is one more problem that it sometimes it does not catch your voice while it is answering your question so you will have to press the button at that time to stop echo from answering. But one thing I would like to say that its speaker is  really good one.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa,1.0,Alexa is ok nice speaker n mic .

When say intend to hear a Tamil song like 'Play Muthu movie songs' it plays muthu Telugu songs.

Unless you want to be like Alexa Play this song and want to hear Sorry infinite number of times.. Please buy any other cheap bluetooth speaker because she won't get connected unless you have a wifi and plus even with wifi she is not worth it.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Pathetic Products,1.0,Not at all worthy. Wastage of money. Performance is not good. And Amazon is not cooperating for return. I got the exchange product today but as usual the set up button is so uncomfortable and its painful to press it for a longer time. And the sound quality is so pathetic that music doesn't seems to melodies. It feels like a non branded local speaker. As usual the wrist product from Amazon. Really unexpected from a Amazon. Very disappointing and Amazon team is not even ready to give my money back.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Absolutely horrifying experience,2.0,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),bad,1.0,when I setup echo dot after 2 hours it told sorry I have trouble understanding right now please try a little later i tried after 2 hours  it was not fixed  and then I replaced the item and again after 2 hours then  told the same thing and again I waited but it was not fixed then i baught google nest mini it was working

My parents have very interest in listening songs at morning time and this product is very important for them. My parents loved this product so much.

Instead of this, in this AI SPEAKER you have to just say ur favourite singers name and speaker will play songs of that singers. Easy to use."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not clear in instructions,4.0,Well it was an offer with 12 watt smart bulb. Offer said pay 200 rs more and get 12 watt bulb.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),This is one of the worst voice assistant ever along with Bixby,1.0,"The Alexa voice assistant will never understand the commands you say.

Interacts with your commands unbelievably.You can listen to All India Radio,online FM channels(e.g Radio Mirchi etc),unlimited songs from saavan and Amazon prime music (you need subscription for both of it).Host of other services are waiting for your command -""Alexa..."".Con: It doesn't have a battery so you can not use it wherever you want.It should be plugged into a power source to operate.It's best for indoor use.It needs subscription for some of its music streaming services.Suggestion: Please add Audible Suno support in it.Overall it is a really great product."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Spy and wireless,1.0,"One has to keep it on for 24hrs. I know why you want to keep, because every time you are feeding alexa with the data. Remember folks, it can also be spy, which is recording your voice.If it get off, u have to again resetup, which is quite tedious and boredom approach.It should be wireless."

It is very very loud but what is lacks is clarity. You will have to connect it a better speaker using Bluetooth.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Nice Device for quick info,3.0,"Good Sound quality, vast collection base, Alex will get confused with some of the request, need to reorganize the search criteria and information from different source. Only disadvantage is that always it should be connected to power supply, without which Alex won't work.  I suggest Amazon to make Alex battery enabled so that we can charge and use it quite often."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"100% for English, hindi and <60%useful for south Indian languages",3.0,Not even  60% fit for south Indians even  after adding tamil skills..most of the tamil or telegu songs it is unable to understand.

I think ur heart don't need anyone if alexa is present with u.It's useful for every age groups. It understands hindi language very accurately nd this is the most lovable thing about alexa. It has a lot of qualities butI'm mentioning only cons depending upon situations:U need a broadband connection or any wifi device to fully utilize the features because it listen to u only when internet worksNd the second thing is 24hour power supply because there is no battery inside it.That's the only reason I returned it.Go for it n I'm sure you'll love it😊😍"

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Satisfied and Happy.,4.0,"Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is the best in terms of hardware. Amazing sound quality with proper balance between base, mids and treble. And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you’d like.Next, is the build quality. It is really good and feels firm. Bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity is awesome. Best part is I can connect it to my phone & laptop and use it as an external speaker.The only downside for me is Alexa. She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge. Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders, alarms, music, etc. however, when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the time.Tip: Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvement."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Waste product without a battery in always needs a power plug with 0 portability,1.0,Waste product as it doesn't come with a baterry so it needs always a plug point to be connected.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Best device with few cons,4.0,Device is very good. Sometime they confuse about the similar word like if I ask one song and if that song has same words of some other song then Alexa will play any song. Other issue I found that Ji Saavn songs not played on Alexa. I don't know the reason. In case if we ask to tell story then Alexa says you have nothing in Kindle app. Or sometimes ask many things need to be purchased. Anyone has faced issues can you tell me solution. Atleast i want know how to connect jio saavn songs to Alexa
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Expectation not reached,3.0,Expected more from this product like we can use at any place if we have internet but it won't work in that way because it doesn't have battery we should plug all the time to socket and also it don't have option to connect different internet connections automatically.I understood that it will useful for listening music and to ask regular queries.Music also it will play all the time from our playlist.Especially we have to use this product only at home
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"She is good, but not that smart.",3.0,Setting up the device is real pain. And making any changes to the existing set up is more painful. Speaker quality is good. Voice assistance works good for music playing but not for any other stuff. Google assistance can be better.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),My review has been deleted that's why i am posting it again!!,2.0,"This might be helpful for you all. So my request is for technical team about this product please do not delete my review.It has got really bad software. Most of the answers of this alexa would be ""sorry i don't know that one"" , ""i am not sure"" which is very annoying & you will get to know this by the time.. google is much much better than alexa. Google is google knows every answers of your question. Alexa is not that good its good for like tuning light on or off, other than that you'r taking it for knowlegde purpose  its not good. Even alexa dont know many of the hit bolleywood song if command it by saying name of the song or artist. I think google is doing better job than alexa. It has really bad software trust me."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Outstanding product,5.0,"Excellent product from Amazon. Worth money. Suitable for those who want to make a smart home of their dream. Wake word ""Alexa"" is more heard than ""echo"" in echo dot. So i prefer ""alexa"". 3rd gen is far good than the previous gen.  Wanna try echo input and echo show also in future. All the best for the team behind AI and Smart tech."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa....taking the world to the next level..,4.0,Item is good....but sometimes if the TV is running and there is a disturbance then it will not pick up your voice....Also the another issue that I found was I am unable to configure it to my Samsung smart TV...which is one of the major drawback....else 5 star ratings for rest of the features
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Its really superb,5.0,I bought this speaker just to automate a few tasks ended up loving the speaker and alexa so much that im buying another speaker for the other room aswell the footprint of this speaker is small but it has a way stronger speaker with good base for its size i was planning connecting it to a bigger speaker but i ended up not doing that because it really packs a punch in audio
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Incredibly Awesome!!,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The echo dot is an incredibly awesome amazon product.Talking about the sound quality, the sound quality is beyond expectation for me, its crystal clear and quite loud as compared to its size. Alexa integration is great, it can do things like movie tickets booking, can book a cab, it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services, can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome. Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.It also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience. It also requires permanent power supply. If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019."

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Prefer Google assistant than alexa,2.0,"It's a waste guys.Settings are very complex.Cannot able to connect as a Bluetooth speaker to my mobile.If I say Alexa play tollywood songs it plays Bollywood songsNo matter what it won't able to understand your commands in indian accemts.Sound quality is very good and 4 inbuilt far field mic s are useless because I will not catch your voice from 2 metre distance also.have to shout loud.Either it understands Hindi or English bases upon settings, not bilingual.Anyhow I got it for 1657 approx.Would prefer Google assistant"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Don't buy it,1.0,I have got it replaced but it's again not working and now fed up  with it's performance.

To play video you need to add akill, to play audio you need to add skillto play movies you need to add skill. I mean seriously? Is Amazon so dumb that they want user to add all those skills manually instead of adding them by default?It cannot connect to smart tv, poor voice recognition, you literally have to shout so that she can here it. If you say ""Alexa play nursery rhymes on Youtube on fire tv"" it will say I don't know what is YouTube. WTH Man!"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),It's 'not that good' speaker review,4.0,"The audio quality is really nice as compared to the size of the speaker, mostly used to listen to classic songsSongs are played incorrectly most of the time unless the Alexa is not given specific keywords of the song by checking on 'Google'Connecting home devices like lights & TV is only to switch on or off so doesn't make sense to pairAll and all the speaker is not upto the my expectations and Google is way way better"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Big wow for sound quality n voice command 😊,5.0,"Happy customer. Sound quality and voice command is amazingly good. But one thing you must ensure that if you need best experience, better opt for Amazon Prime subscription first. Coz it will sure work with other music apps, but you will not get the great collection of Amazon Music."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Consider this only if you are ok with random things otherwise you need a lot of patience for this.,3.0,What I hate is it skips songs from a playlist.I have saved  Sundarkand which has 4 parts in Amazon music.Alexa skips part  2 or 3 and plays the next one.This has happened 4-5 times.I have written to alexa help center but no response on this.I have gone back to mobile app .
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),THE MOST HONEST REVIEW,5.0,"Extremely awesome and well integrated device. I watched a lot of videos claiming that google home is much better in software and search related tasks. But seriously saying you can go for it without a second thought. I didn't found any trouble with search related tasks however continued conversation is a bit limited but rest everything is just awesome. And a HIGHLIGHTED POINT ""GOOGLE CAN'T BEAT THE SKILLS AND EASY OF USE OF ALEXA"". Alexa comes with thousands of skills and fun games and much more....."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good device to possess,4.0,"Playing music, knowing about weather or latest news, setting reminders etc have never been easier. My kid is a big Alexa fan and keeps interacting with the echo dot. Clearly it's very easy to use. Though, it was a bit difficult to connect with the OnePlus TV. Some basic TV functions can be performed but there is lot more required. The next generation devices will probably have more advance features."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Need to improve out side entertainment skills,3.0,Echo was good with superb sound bought along with wipro smart bulb... both are working as I expect... but echo has to improve skills rather than entertainment....most of the time i ended with not getting as I want.... mainly after query echo has to repeat the query and then it follows... but no need to repeat the query...... makes user more comfortable
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Amazing product with Alexa,4.0,Product is good.Sound quality is soft. I bought two and plays it in synchronised.

And also need to improve some security features over securing users data and some sound detection mechanism.8. Overall it's a good speaker along with a good personal assistant."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Failed to respond,3.0,"Maybe I was unlucky as Alexa at times didn’t respond to voice commands. We have jiofiber at home with speeds upto 150 mbps, given the internet speeds Alexa should not have problems with responding to voice commands. Returned the product and was disappointed, could be one of defective product."

 Most of the time dont understand what song you are requesting...most popular songs cant be played...which is very annoying. But good for alexa devices"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Overall good for above 10 years children not for above 30 years.,4.0,I like the sound clarity with Alexa interaction but Alexa most of the things and questions didn't identify and she is not known about the questions. That is the minus point here. I saw Google Assistant is better than the Alexa because Google can make the call to your contacts but Alexa is only for those people who installed the Alexa Application on their phone.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Does the job,4.0,"It doesn't recognize your voice from a distance, when it's already playing a song. U need to go near always. At times we need to keep repeating our commands again and again. Else all good."

It is just like a physically person talking to you.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Useless after a while,3.0,I know people make a really productive of use of alexa but it really isnt useful if youre just wanting to get it for entertainment purposes as the speaker quality isnt that great if youre planning to listen to music and it overalls gets booring after a while and would lie unplugged in a corner of a room.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Fedup with Alexa Eco dot speaker 😐,1.0,"My expectations was very high when I bought Alexa Eco dot speaker.When I Say play song “gulabi ankhe ho teri Dekhi” it doesn’t understand and plays different song.Sometimes I have to shout on Alexa while giving the command to Alexa for playing song,bcz of software issue it does not listen in a one time.I am really fed up with Alexa speaker and I do not use it.Amazon I did not expect from you😡"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Right after i purchased echo dot you lowered its price by 20%. unbelievable!,4.0,Product is good but the pricing is quite tricky. i purchased @ 3500 for fathers day special offer and the next day you put it up for 2799.So fathers day special price was higher than normal.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Good just as a bluetooth speaker,4.0,When you already have google assisatant voice recognition shouldn't be much of a deal. Alexa needs to be plugged in and conected to a wifi network to function as alexa! If no wifi it acts as a bluetooth speaker. The sound qualitu is pretty good other than alexa being alexa isnt as much fun as you think it is :)
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Alexa unable to identify songs requested, looking for a replacement if possible",1.0,Alexa is unable to identify songs placed to it and most of the time get a negative response of unavailability of our request. Seems to be a waste product for me.Looking for a replacement of this device which seems to have an access to limited resource.Sound of Alexa needs improvisation.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Love its Hinglish (English+Hindi) version. Must buy,5.0,"An absolutely house hold item at a fair price. Its intuitive, speech recognition is superb we use it for hindi and english and sometimes ‘Hinglish’ also :-), a big thanks to the Amazon team. Even while its placed in Drawing room and we call Alexa from bedroom, it has all the ears to us and plays our favourite songs flawlessly. Overall a best fit and a must have.

Now I don't have to search anything on youtube just say that song to alexa and it plays..... really happy with this product. Just one thing it doesn't work on battery. It should have battery support as well."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not worth buying,1.0,"I found this useless, we have to connect it with phone which is difficult process.We have smart phone which does all the things. normal speaker can be more usefull than this."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Great tech... normal speaker would have worked fine for someone like me though!,3.0,"My mother really likes it for me... the voice recognition needs optimization! i call japanese artist clearly but alexa who needs better hearing will play some trendy hindi songs instead, sometimes destroys the moodAll in all great but I prefer normal bluetooth speaker and control it from my phone no jhanjhat no disappointment."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Consistently bad! Should be a Smart Asst. of Bezos,2.0,"After quite a few months of using this, considering the amount I paid for it, I've stopped using it as a smart assistant. Coz it's dumb. Hey Alexa, here's an idea. Be better, or stop snooping around.It's good as a speaker though."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Worth it,4.0,"Overall this is a good speaker, sound quality is really awesome as i have used JBL so i can say that the sound is as good as JBL. But Alexa is not polished in hindi, for alarm , reminder and music playing this is a great device at all and as well as Alexa is doing good with smart home devices.And one more thing wait for a sale then buy it."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Alexa won't respond to Stop commands!,1.0,"I am very happy with my new alexa echo dot device. It turned out better than i expected. The speakers on this device are great. But the only problem I have is that whenever i try to stop a playing music, news flashing, podcast midway. It doesn't stop the music. I have tired various different commands pause, stop current song, etc."
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Issue with the Microphone,5.0,UPDATE- GOT MY ALEXA REPLACED BY AMAZON.(Mic works fine now)THE NRW ONE WORKS FINE. BUT THE SOUND QUALITY LEAVES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. Mic isn't proper. Please return this product.It feels like there is a problem with my device only.It cannot her me at 1st or 2nd time. after I speak the wake work multiple times then it hears.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Most OverHyped Product ever,2.0,Sound Quality is best for its price and can be used as only speaker but that's jut 1000Rs. expensive than Mi speakers or even JBL if brand value considered.connectivity and Voice recognition is worst amongst all even including Google speakers and apple one's.e.g. try Ishare tere by Guru Randhawa on this and some similar type of songs it will either play random songs or just english one's.
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Nice but with limitations,4.0,It is a good product at this price but has major limitation of being wired connection. It takes 30-40 secs to start again and anything you want to listen you have to add in ur app which is a time consuming activity.  But overall i took it for my 2 yr kid to distract him from mobile phones and it is helping me in that 😊😊 he enjoys dance well on the tunes now 👍👍

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),It does one thing and does that well-Alexa : Audio quality is not it's USP,4.0,"The far field voice recognition doesn't work very well with this echo device. The Echo spot did this job much better. Audio quality is not comparable to bluetooth speakers at the same price point, however it does one thing and does that well, which is Alexa integration. It's a joy to have Alexa plan your day and remind you of things that would go on to save your life ! Thanks Alexa! Not much thanks to the audio quality :)"
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),"Doesn't respond well, keep getting disconnected, breaking sound, always keep yelling alexa alexa",2.0,"It doesn't listen maxium times, limited to few apps and most time it goeso n to a red mode where it says wifi problem or it can't understand. So him many times sin this world I should keep saying alexa alexa... It fails to understand commands properly and this setup issue. Mmn then to connect to my cel phone Bluetooth was another saga.

Overall it is a great product to keep at home.A big thanks to its Hindi version. My mom gets up early in morning and asks it to play Bhajans and it makes the morning more beautiful. No battery drainage worries and no worries of typing and finding any particular song on phone.

Hats off to them. It is fun talking to alexa. Alexa provides us our day to day information. Though a few upgradations are also required for alexa software.There is just one drawback of this product that in sound quality, there is improper balance between bass and treble.

I have placed a complaint and it will be replaced. But now I am very doubtful about the quality.

Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Not worth,3.0,Voice recognition is very bad and does not recognise the words for at least 50% of the time. Integration is good.. does not cause any problems while integrating. Half of the time very popular songs also are not recognised by Alexa. No settings to store the language preferences. All the time you have to choose which language you want to hear the songs
Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black),Nice product but with a little lacking,4.0,"About voice recognition , Alexa integration I would say, it is fine but as compared to bose this echo dot lags behind but over all this is not bad at this budget price.
